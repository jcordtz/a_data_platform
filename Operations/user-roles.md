## Roles

We will use roles as a mechanism of controlling access to the *data* and *datasets*  in the data platform as well as assigning the right responsibilities to persons having these roles.

Of course, the roles must be delegated to people. How the roles are connected to people, and if certain people have more than one role, doesn't really matter. The most important thing is that the processes comply with the "rules" of the data platform paradigm.

This is a list of common roles seen with our clients:

1. Project owner
   - Interface to a steering group/management.
   - Most like likely coming from “Business”

2. Project Leader
   - Leads the specific project
   - Most like likely coming from “IT”

3. Data Engineer
   - Creates the integration between a source system and the **ingest area**.
   - Most likely coming from “IT”

4. Designer
   - Designs (and creates) the different *dataset* to be used by the business
   - Most likely coming from “Business”

5. Transform engineer
   - Creates the transformation processes used in the **transform** and **publish area**
   - Most likely coming from “IT”

6. Data Governance
   - Ensures that the understanding between IT and Business are aligned and that governance principles are followed
   - Most likely coming from “IT/Business”

7. Superuser/Ambassador
   - Defines (and creates) reports/dashboard and other usage patterns
   - Most likely coming from “Business”

8. System owner
   - Provides understanding about how a source system is being used
   - Most likely coming from “Business”

9. Architect
   - Ensures that the architectural principles are being followed
   - Most likely coming from “IT”

Depending on the size of project, size of company and/or framework being used you could also meet roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, Program Owner, Steering Committee member etc.

The needs of the different roles will naturally differ through a project. The following is an example of what the “workload” could look like:

|Role|Ideation|Iteration 1|Iteration 2|Iteration 3|Iteration 4|Iteration ….|Vision state|
|----|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
|Project Owner|100 %|25%|25%|25%|25%|25%|100%|
|Project Leader|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|
|Data Engineer|100%|50%|25%|5%|5%|5%|0%|
|Designer|100%|10%|10%|25%|25%|40%|0%|
|Transform Engineer|100%|30%|30%|30%|30%|30%|0%|
|Data Governance|100%|25%|25%|10%|10%|10%|10%|
|Superuser/Ambassador|100%|5%|5%|20%|20%|50%|100%|
|System owner|100%|25%|10%|0%|0%|0%|10%|
|Architect|100%|50%|25%|10%|10%|10%|10%|

1. Ideation – Project start including ideas to be listed (backlogged)
2. Iteration X – the individual “versions” – most likely in 3-month timespans
3. Vision State – overall what is the projects going to accomplish
