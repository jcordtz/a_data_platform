# Microsoft Purview and the data platform

Microsoft Purview is a comprehensive set of solutions that can help organizations govern, protect, and manage data, wherever it resides. Microsoft Purview solutions provide integrated coverage and help address the fragmentation of data across organizations, the lack of visibility that hampers data protection and governance, and the blurring of traditional IT management roles.

Microsoft Purview combines the former Azure Purview and Microsoft 365 compliance solutions and services together into a unified platform to help organizations:

- Gain visibility into data across your organization
- Safeguard and manage sensitive data across its lifecycle, wherever it lives
- Govern data seamlessly in new, comprehensive ways
- Manage critical data risks and regulatory requirements

In connection with the data platform Microsoft Purview is one of the supporting data services. Its main tasks is of course being the Governance and Compliance anchor point.

But just as important Microsoft Purview provides the capability of providing a Data Catalog and in this having Data Products described.

This is a very important capability in connection with the data platform as it provides the following functionalities:

Providing a **"search engine"** where users entering the **consume** area can see/find what they have access to, what this represents and whom to contact for different assets within their "data catalog".

One of the aspects of the data platform is that **"a database only exists if being used"** means that a database is removed when not being used and then re-created when needed. Hence Microsoft Purview could play the important role of both document that the database "was there" and when/if being re-created can work as a place to refere to ensure that the structures in the re-created database are "as they were".
