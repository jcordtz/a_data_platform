Microsoft Purview is a comprehensive set of solutions that can help organizations govern, protect, and manage data wherever it resides. Microsoft Purview solutions provide integrated coverage and help address the fragmentation of data across organizations, the lack of visibility that hampers data protection and governance, and the blurring of traditional IT management roles.

*Microsoft Purview* combines the previous *Azure Purview* and *Microsoft 365 Compliance* solutions and compliance services into a unified platform that helps organizations to:

- Gain insight into data across your organization
- Protect and manage sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, wherever it resides
- Manage data seamlessly in new, comprehensive ways
- Manage critical data risks and regulatory requirements

For the purposes of the data platform, Microsoft Purview  is one of the supporting data services. *Microsoft Purview*'s main task is, of course, to be the anchor point of Governance and Compliance.

But just as important, *Microsoft Purview*  provides the ability to provide a data catalog and in this have data products described.

This is a very important feature in the context of the data platform, as it provides the following functionalities:

1) Access to a **"search engine"**, where users who enter the **consume** area can see/find which *datasets* exist.
2) Ask for access to these if you do not have one.
3) Get a comprehensive description of what a given *dataset* represents
4) See who to contact in relation to these *datasets* for help.

## A slightly more advanced use of Microsoft Purview

One of the aspects of the data platform is that "a database only exists if it is used"** means that a database can/should be removed when not in use, and then recreated when needed. Here, *Microsoft Purview*  can play the important role of both documenting that the database "was there" and when/if it is recreated, can serve as a place to refer to to ensure that the structures of the recreated database are "as they were".
