## Introduction

Data lineage is the process of tracing the journey that data takes within an organization, from its origin to its final destination.
It captures the lifecycle of data, including its source, transformations, movements, and interactions with various systems and users.

By documenting this path, organizations gain a clear understanding of how data is generated, processed, and consumed. 
Think of data lineage as the “history book” of your organization’s data. 

It answers critical questions like:

1) Where did this data come from?
2) How has it been transformed over time?
3) Who has accessed or modified it?
4) Is the data accurate and reliable?
5) What dependencies exist?
6) Where does the data go?

## Importance of Data Lineage

Data lineage is critical in modern data ecosystems because it ensures transparency, accountability, and trust in data processes. Here's why it matters:

1) Improved Data Quality and Integrity: By tracking the journey of data, lineage helps identify errors or inconsistencies at any stage—whether at the source, during transformation, or in final outputs.
2) Enhanced Troubleshooting and Debugging: When something goes wrong in data pipelines, lineage provides a clear view of the flow, making it easier to pinpoint and resolve issues.
3) Regulatory Compliance: Many industries have strict data governance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Data lineage demonstrates accountability and helps organizations comply with these regulations.
4) Impact Analysis for Changes: When modifying systems, data lineage shows how proposed changes might affect downstream applications, reports, or users, reducing risks.
5) Strengthened Data Governance: Lineage provides visibility into who uses the data, how it's processed, and where it's stored—ensuring accountability and responsible usage.
6) Increased Efficiency: By understanding dependencies and connections, data teams can streamline workflows, optimize processes, and avoid duplicating efforts.
7) Building Trust in Data: Stakeholders are more likely to rely on data-driven decisions when they can see a clear record of the data's origins and transformations.
