## Introduction

Data discovery is the process of exploring, finding, and classifying data sources, making it useful for some purpose. It helps businesses in a variety of ways, 
often to discover patterns, solve business problems, inform strategy, and gather other insights from advanced analytics. In terms of privacy compliance, data discovery
refers to the process of finding data that must be managed in some way to achieve compliance and data security. This could involve identifying systems that collect personal
