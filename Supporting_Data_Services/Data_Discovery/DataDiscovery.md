## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, organizations are constantly seeking ways to harness the power of their data to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and drive innovation. One of the key processes that enable this is *Data Discovery*.

*Data Discovery* provides a dynamic and iterative process that involves exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data from various sources to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. This section discusses some of the aspects of *Data Discovery*, its methods and outcomes.

## What is *Data Discovery*?

*Data Discovery* is the process of detecting elements like outliers, patterns, and trends in data which most likely comes from multiple sources.
It enables users to visually navigate data relationships and apply advanced analytics to optimize business decisions and performance. By simplifying complex *data* into clear easy to use *datasets*, *Data Discovery* effectively acts as a possible enabler for data-driven actions.

*Data Discovery* should not be considered a reporting capability as we with *Data Discovery* seeks the “unknown” whereas reporting supports the day-to-day process that needs to be the same and only change slowly over “long time”.

## Methods of *Data Discovery*

*Data Discovery* can be achieved through both manual and automated processes. Manual processes require extensive knowledge of data organization and involve collecting, cataloging, and sifting through data to find new and yet unknown valuable insights.

Automated processes leverage AI and machine learning to streamline analysis, ensure data reliability, and enhance query execution efficiency.
These methods enable users to quickly find and use relevant trusted *datasets* through streamlined access request workflows.

In the *Data Platform* some of our customers has established a [project room](https://github.com/jcordtz/a_data_platform?tab=readme-ov-file#development-environment---project-room), they call *Data Discovery*.
This gives them the capability to quickly establish an environment to be used for discovery and still be in control of what data is being used.

The data available can then come from the **publish area** making the *Data Discovery* a part of the **consume area**, as well a data that is directly ingest as Raw Data depending of what the 
project in question is trying to achieve.

## Steps in the *Data Discovery* Process

The *Data Discovery* process is cyclical and iterative, comprising several key steps:

1) Goal Setting: Define the objectives and desired outcomes of the *Data Discovery* process.
2) Aggregation: Collect data from diverse sources, including internal databases, external datasets, and third-party providers.
3) Preparation: Clean, transform, and organize the data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
4) Visualization: Use visual tools to explore data relationships and detect patterns, trends, and outliers.
5) Analysis: Apply advanced analytics to extract actionable insights and drive informed decision-making.
6) Repetition: Continuously refine the process to maintain relevance to business objectives.

## Benefits of *Data Discovery*

*Data Discovery* offers several benefits that enhance business decisions and performance:

1) Improved Decision Making: Enables non-technical business leaders to comprehend complex datasets through visual tools, enhancing business intelligence and allowing stakeholders to improve efficiencies.
2) Reduced Dependency on IT Teams: Bridges the gap between data preparers and decision-makers, ensuring that those interpreting the data can do so without heavy reliance on IT experts.
3) Optimized Business Processes: Identifies opportunities for cost savings, ensures data security and accuracy, and adheres to privacy regulations.
4) Enhanced Customer Experiences: Reveals friction points in user journeys, provides insights for more personalized experiences, and identifies areas for improvement in products or services.

## Why *Data Discovery* Matters

*Data Discovery* plays an essential role in various facets of a business. It fosters AI readiness by creating structured, reliable data that AI models can analyze more effectively. This foundation enables businesses to harness AI tools confidently, driving more accurate insights and innovative applications. Additionally, *Data Discovery* empowers teams by facilitating democratization, allowing everyone in an organization to explore and comprehend data easily.


## Conclusion

*Data Discovery* is a powerful process that enables organizations to unlock the full potential of their data. By exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data from diverse sources, businesses can uncover valuable insights, optimize processes, and drive innovation. As the data landscape continues to evolve, *Data Discovery* will remain a critical component of data-driven decision-making and performance optimization.
