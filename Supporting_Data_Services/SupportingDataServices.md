[Data Catalog](Data_Catalog/DataCatalog.md) – a “directory database” where we record and explain which *data* and *datasets* are available in the data platform. This would also cover elements like ownership, usage guidelines etc.

[Common Data Model](Common_Data_Model/CommonDataModel.md) – Especially for the **publish area**, existing industry *data* models could be useful/relevant.

[Data Discovery](Data_Discovery/DataDiscovery.md) – A data science process oriented to business users that allows them to visually explore data and apply advanced analytics to find patterns, gain insight and answer specific business questions.

[Data Lineage](Data_Lineage/DataLineage.md) – Documentation on how data is being “transferred” and transformed between the different areas. It can be both a technical lineage – “what actions were performed on the data” - as well as a business lineage - “where do these data originate from?”.

[Data Governance](Data_Governance/DataGovernance.md) – Processes, policies, rules and reports to ensure that the data is governed properly. Often based on frameworks like ISO27x or NIST.

[Master Data](Master_Data/MasterData.md) – Some *data*/*datasets*  might benefit from being treated as master data, ensuring that there is only “one record” of i.e. a customer.
