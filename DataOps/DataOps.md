## Introduction

While DataOps started as a set of best practices, it has now evolved to become a new and distinct approach to data analytics. DataOps covers the whole data lifecycle from data preparation to reporting and acknowledges the interdependent nature of the data analytics team and information technology operations.

In software development, DevOps emphasizes continuous delivery by using on-demand IT resources and by automating test and deployment of software. This way of software development and IT operations has improved velocity, quality, predictability and scale of software engineering and deployment.

Taking methods from DevOps, DataOps aims to bring these same improvements to data analytics. DataOps should not be linked to a specific technology, architecture, tool, language, or framework.
